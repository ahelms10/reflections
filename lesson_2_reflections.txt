What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?

git creates a .git directory to begin tracking the directory

You need to do it so that changes begin being tracked

How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository? What value do you think it offers?

The staging area allows you to park a file you are ready to commit and pair it with other files that should be committed together.
You can stage a file before working on another change or before you are ready to commit other files
