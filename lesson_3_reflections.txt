Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?
There may be a feature or bug you are working on that you don't want to publish for others to see or to impact your working branch

When would you want to make changes in a separate branch rather than directly in master? What benefits does each approach have?

If you are working on a feature that modifies the same part of the code someone else is working on 

Benefits
-multiple people can work on the codebase at the same time
-it's easy to merge
